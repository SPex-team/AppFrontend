    title: 'How does the miner account market work?',
    answer: `There are two roles: seller and buyer.
    Sellers (the SPs) transfer in miners, bind their address in the contract as delegator, and list miners for sale. They can withdraw/transfer out miners anytime. When a buyer purchases, ownership transfers via smart contract. The purchase amount distributes to the seller after deducting fees.Buyers can click to buy preferred miners. The purchased miner appears in their profile, ready to relist or withdraw/transfer out.`

    title: 'Why doesnâ€™t the owner address of the miner change after I purchased the miner? ',
    answer:
      "The relationship between the new owner and the purchased miner will reflect only on the contract, only if you complete the step of the transfer out the miner from the contract to you, then this ownership will officially transfer to your address and the ownership address will present to yours on the chain, but before transfer out the miner, the ownership of the miner is still yours based on the function of _minersDelegators in the contract, just won't show the chain but will present/reflect in the contract."
